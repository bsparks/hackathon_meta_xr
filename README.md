The blacksmith, magic shop, and tavern you only need to walk up to the NPC, when they have greeted you then they are ready to talk, you don't have to look at them, it's a trigger. The skull you will need to look at (uses a raycast from center eye) in order to talk to. I didn't have time to finish all of their dialogs. The blacksmith is the only one that will display items for sale that you can pick up and ask about. All of the NPCs should respond to being asked what their name is. All 3 shop keepers should tell you the kinds of things that they sell. You can also ask the barkeep and mage about jobs they might have (they will just tell you something, quests are not setup). If it seems like they are getting stuck or not responding, you can try to press A on the right stick and it will activate the voice manually. You can ask the smith to show you swords, maces, daggers, or bows. The bows are a bit wonky and don't work properly with the sales question. Once you pick up an item you can ask how much it costs. You can't complete the transaction however yet. I generated all of the voices for the characters using Replica Studios AI, though it is not on the fly.
